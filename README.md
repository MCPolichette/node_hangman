## NODE HANGMAN GAME

Welcome to my hangman app

This is an experiment using multiple javascript files, and integrating with the node interfase.  It incorporates a lot of the same logic that I used in a previous hangman style game, except this time it uses constructors in different files to complete the task.

In my game file, I created, different lists, 
*European Countries
*States
*Top 50 Movies (edited out movies with alphebetical characters ie: Se7en)

This project was difficult to figure out at first, but I was able to understand methodology over time, and things fell into place as the project got moving.  Most difficult was connecting the constructors together to  get expected results.

Thank you
